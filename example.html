            <h2>More Shapes!</h2>
            <p>This shape is a Trapezoid, which offers more space than a Triangle and is suitable for somewhat longer texts. Other shapes are available too, such as regular and split
            Triangles.</p>
            <p>Triangly will automatically arrange your shapes to optimally use the available space. All you need to do is to ensure there is a balanced amount
            of left-pointing and right-pointing triangles, which is achieved by alternating between the two.</p>
            <p>Even when the triangles are rearranged, they never flip around and always point the same way. This gives you some reliability when layouting
            your content inside the triangle, so you can make sure it never looks weird.</p>
            <p>To style Triangly, we recommend supplying your own stylesheet on top of the provided Triangly stylesheet.</p>
